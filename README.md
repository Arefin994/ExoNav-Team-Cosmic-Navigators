## Features

### Home Page 🏠
The landing page gives an overview of the website's features and provides a sneak peek into all its sections.

### Explore Page 🔭
This page utilizes the [NASA Exoplanet Archive API](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_queries.html) to display detailed information about all known exoplanets. It also includes interactive 3D models of these celestial bodies, offering a more engaging experience for users.

### AI Page 🤖
Powered by the Gemini API, this page introduces an AI chatbot specifically designed to provide information about exoplanets. Users can chat with the bot, ask questions, and even share images for more interactive learning.

### Game Page 🎮
We created a game using the **Unity Game Engine** and deployed it via WebGL for seamless integration. The game offers an immersive experience on a fictional exoplanet, featuring interactions with alien creatures and locomotion systems. We utilized Unity’s free assets and a 3D character model from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/).

### VR Page 🕶️
In this section, users can explore 3 custom-made exoplanets designed using Unity’s **Terrain Creator**. The VR experience allows users to gather more information as they traverse these alien landscapes. Some 3D models were sourced from NASA’s [3D Resources](https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/models), and we also developed custom textures and utilized Unity’s free assets.
